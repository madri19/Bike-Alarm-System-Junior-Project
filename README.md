# Bike-Alarm-System-Junior-Project
Junior Project with Giselle Freude. Created a bike alarm system that sends you push notifications over the GSM network implemented with sensors and a PIC32MX microcontroller. Android App Developement + hosting MQTT server was done by Giselle and hardware module interfacing developement and MQTT support for PIC32 was done by Juan. We worked on the full final implementation together. The GSM-MQTT implementation is a ported version from the Arduino C language syntax to the PIC32 C language syntax.
